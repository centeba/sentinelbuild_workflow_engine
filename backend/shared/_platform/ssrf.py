"""Canonical SSRF guard for outbound HTTP from platform services.

Any feature that fetches an author- or tenant-supplied URL (workflow
``http_request`` / ``web_scraper`` nodes, outbound webhooks) can be steered at
cloud metadata (``169.254.169.254``), ``localhost``, or internal services — and
can replay an injected credential to an attacker-chosen internal host. This is
the single implementation every service should use, replacing the previously
duplicated per-service guards.

Two layers:

1. :func:`validate_url` — reject non-http(s) schemes and any host that resolves
   to a private / loopback / link-local / CGNAT / metadata address. Sufficient
   on its own for a pre-flight check.

2. :func:`guarded_send` — **connect-time IP pinning** that closes the
   TOCTOU / DNS-rebind window the pre-flight check alone leaves open. It
   resolves the host once, validates *every* resolved address, then connects to
   the exact validated IP while preserving the original ``Host`` header and TLS
   SNI (so certificate verification still checks the real hostname). Redirects
   are followed manually and each hop is re-validated + re-pinned, and a
   cross-host redirect drops the ``Authorization`` header so an injected
   credential can't be bounced to another origin.
